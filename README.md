# Pokemon-Battle

## Project Overview üöÄ
Pokemon-Battle is a console-based game developed as a university assignment, aimed at demonstrating the practical usage 
of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in building engaging applications. The game allows players to engage in battles using 
classic Pok√©mon characters, leveraging various ADTs for efficient gameplay management.

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: `Python 3.x`

## Development Process üñ•Ô∏è
- **Base Class Creation**: Developed Pokemon_base.py as the foundation for Pok√©mon objects, defining common methods and 
abstract methods for specialization in child classes.
- **Child Class Development**: Implemented child classes for Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur in pokemon.py, 
providing players with initial Pok√©mon choices.
- **Team Management**: Created pokemon_team.py to manage player teams, including functionalities for team composition 
and ADT-based team selection.
- **Battle Mechanics**: Developed battle.py to handle the game's battle logic, offering three distinct battle modes: 
set mode, rotating mode, and optimized mode.
- **Add Additional Pokemon**: Extend to add a new type of pokemon to the game that is a different type from the existing
ones with special ability.

## Learning Outcomes üß†
- **Class Inheritance and OOP Principles**: Gained proficiency in using class inheritance, abstract methods, super() 
method, and static methods for efficient and cleaner code.
- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**: Enhanced understanding of choosing appropriate ADTs for different data structures, 
leading to better data management.
- **Encapsulation**: Implemented encapsulation to protect data integrity, using private attributes and methods.
- **Clean Code Practices**: Improved code readability and maintenance by adhering to the Single Responsibility 
Principle, ensuring each class and method has a focused purpose.

## Proposed Improvements üí≠
### Within Project Scope
- **Enhanced Battle Statistics**: Implement helper methods in the battle class for more effective round statistics 
display.
- **Refined Attack Process**: Separate attack processing and damage calculation for clearer code responsibility.
- **Universal Team Assignment**: Develop helper methods for team assignment applicable across all battle modes, reducing
code redundancy.
### Future Enhancements
- **Expanded Pok√©mon Roster**: Introduce more Pok√©mon options for varied gameplay.
- **Additional Battle Modes**: Implement new battle modes for enhanced player experience.
- **Interactive Attack Selection**: Allow players to choose Pok√©mon for subsequent attacks, increasing user engagement.
- **Richer User Feedback**: Provide detailed battle feedback, like HP status after attacks, for a more immersive 
experience.
- **Display Management**: Create a separate class for output handling (CLI or GUI) to decouple game logic from display, 
improving code readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started üö¶
- You can `fork` the repository to your GitHub account or `clone` it directly to your local machine. Once you have a copy 
of the project, you can run it locally on your machine. 

- The project does not have a file to run the game, as it only stores the logic of the game. The entry point of the game
is the `battle.py` class. Please create a new `Battle (trainer_one_name: str, trainer_two_name: str)` object and then 
either `set_mode_battle()`, `rotating_mode_battle()`, or `optimized_mode_battle()` to start the game in desired mode. 

## Contributions
As this is a university assignment, multiple students had contributed to the project which I have derived from and 
improved upon. To protect the integrity of the assignment and the students' privacy, the names of the contributors 
will not be disclosed.
